# A\* Algorithm visual demonstration

## Overview

This is a demonstration of the [A\* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) for machine learning. Specifically, this program operates on a maze made up of a series of 1's and 0's. The algorithm will attempt to find the shortest route to the exit, or determine that there is no path available. After running the program, a window will appear where the steps of the algorithm are visualized. Here is an example of what you will see.

## Usage

The maze itself can be found in maze.txt. Configuration of the maze is fairly simple 7
